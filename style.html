<h2>London</h2>
<p> London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities[16][17][18] and has been termed the world's most powerful,[19] most desirable,[20] most influential,[21] most visited,[22] most expensive,[23][24] innovative,[25] sustainable,[26] most investment friendly,[27] most popular for work,[28] and the most vegetarian friendly[29] city in the world. London exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation.[30][31] London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic performance.[32] It is one of the largest financial centres[33] and has either the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP.[note 3][34][35][36][37][38] It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals[39] and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic.[40] It is the leading investment destination,[41][42][43][44] hosting more international retailers[45][46] and ultra high-net-worth individuals[47][48] than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[49] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[

<h2>Indonesia</h2>
<p>The name Indonesia derives from the Greek name of the Indos (Ἰνδός) and the word nesos (νῆσος), meaning "Indian islands".[20] The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[21] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesians—and, his preference, Malayunesians—for the inhabitants of the "Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago".[22] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago.[23][24] However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia; they preferred Malay Archipelago (Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indië), popularly Indië; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde.[25]
